<h3>Our History</h3>
<p><div class="bordered-text">
Founded in 2018, HydroCar started out of a small town on the Mississippi River. By taking run-off water from the river, we transformed the engine into a steam powered force of nature. Since then our mission has been to reduce wasted water, and we have been making strides in that area. With our breakthroughs in Formula 1, with a steam powered car, our revelations have been groundbreaking.</div></p>
